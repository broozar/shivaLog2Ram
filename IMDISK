"I have received some e-mails with questions whether or not it is okay to include this driver in a commercial product. The answer is yes, just like all other tools I publish here. However, note that a few lines of code are under the GNU GPL license. More specifically, the driver code related to floppy emulation. Some of the driver code is also ported to Windows NT from the FreeBSD 'md' driver.

This means that if you modify the code and/or include it in and/or redistribute it along with your own product, all of the modified/integrated/redistributed product that you distribute needs to be redistributed under GPL, including source code. If you wish to avoid GPL requirements, such as the need to redistribute source code, you would therefore need to remove all floppy emulation related code from the driver. I will be happy to do such modifications for you to make the code comply with your license requirements. Just send me an e-mail!"
